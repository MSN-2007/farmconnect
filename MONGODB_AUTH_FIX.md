# MongoDB Authentication Issue - Solutions

## Current Problem

Authentication is failing with error code 8000. This means the username or password is incorrect, or the user doesn't have proper permissions.

## Solution Options

### Option 1: Verify Username and Password (Recommended)

1. Go to https://cloud.mongodb.com
2. Click **Database Access** (left sidebar)
3. Check if user `mdsufiyannaveed_db_user` exists
4. If it doesn't exist or you're unsure of the password:
   - Click **Add New Database User**
   - Username: `farmconnect_user` (or any name you want)
   - **Autogenerate Secure Password** (copy it!)
   - Database User Privileges: **Atlas admin** or **Read and write to any database**
   - Click **Add User**

5. Update your `.env` with the new credentials:
```
MONGO_URI=mongodb+srv://NEW_USERNAME:NEW_PASSWORD@cluster0db01.tq75ums.mongodb.net/farm-connect?retryWrites=true&w=majority&appName=Cluster0db01
```

### Option 2: Reset Existing User Password

1. Go to **Database Access**
2. Find user `mdsufiyannaveed_db_user`
3. Click **Edit**
4. Click **Edit Password**
5. Choose **Autogenerate Secure Password** (copy it!)
6. Click **Update User**
7. Update `.env` with new password

### Option 3: Use Localhost MongoDB (Temporary)

If you want to test locally first before fixing Atlas:

```bash
# In .env, change back to:
MONGO_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/farm-connect
```

Then install and run MongoDB locally, or use this for testing only.

## Quick Test

After updating credentials, restart server:
```bash
node server.js
```

You should see: `✅ MongoDB Connected`

## Current Connection String

Your `.env` currently has:
```
mongodb+srv://mdsufiyannaveed_db_user:8125997774%2EMsn@cluster0db01.tq75ums.mongodb.net/farm-connect
```

**Most likely issue**: The password `8125997774.Msn` might not be correct, or the user doesn't exist with that exact name.

## Recommended Action

Create a new database user with an autogenerated password - it's the quickest and most reliable solution.
